## The Math

A brief description of the mathematical concepts or modes of thinking that you have drawn upon in your submission.

## The Submission

A short but thorough explanation of your submission. What is the mathematical "point" of your submission? How does it illustrate the mathematical concepts you describe in an engaging way? Who do you envision the target audience to be?

## Additional Notes

Anything we should know about the code, the team, or anything else.

Along with this completed readme, this repository should contain **the single file** or files needed for your submission. For example, if this submission is a _Math Square_ behavior, only submit the JavaScript or TypeScript file containing the behavior, not the entire source of the exhibit.
